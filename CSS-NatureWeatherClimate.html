<h1>Nature, Weather and Climate</h1>

<p>The spectacular nature of Norway is diverse, with forest-covered hills in the
southeast and sublime fjords and glaciers in the west and the North.
 Your Study in Norway experience will thus never be a dull one.</p>

<p>In Northern Norway there is midnight sun in summer; summer is literally one
long day and evening that never turns into night. In winter, the sun never
rises above the horizon, though the sky is sometimes lit by northern lights.</p>

<p>Norwegians hold nature in high esteem. We love our nature, and are proud of it.
Outdoor life is a fundamental part of Norwegian culture: we spend time in the
mountains in spring, summer, autumn and winter. In summer we like to hike from
cabin to cabin, and in winter we go skiing. Cabin life is, however, not
restricted to the mountains; Norwegians also have cabins inland and along the
fjords and coastline.</p>

<p> Closeness to nature is important to Norwegians. Most cities are located near
 popular protected outdoor areas. In most places, an hour’s walk from the city
 centre is all it takes to reach semi-wilderness. If you study at the University
 of Oslo, at NTNU in Trondheim or at the University of Tromsø, ski trails are
 almost directly accessible from campus. And for those based in Bergen, the mountain
 plateau Vidden is never more than an hour away from the reading room.</p>
