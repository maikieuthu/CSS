<h2 style="text-align:center;">GDP Ranked by Country 2021</h2>

<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary market value of all final goods
and services made within a country during a specific period. GDP helps to provide
a snapshot of a country’s economy and can be calculated using expenditures,
production, or incomes.</p>

<h3>World GDP</h3>

<p>The world GDP is the added total of the gross national income for every country
in the world. Gross national income takes a country’s GDP, adds the value of
income from imports, and subtracts the value of money from exports.<strong> The value
of gross national income, GNI, differs from that of GDP because it reflects
the impact of domestic and international trade.</strong></p>

<h3>Nominal GDP vs. PPP GDP</h3>
<p>To compare GDPs around the world, currencies must be converted so that they’re
consistent across all countries. There are two main systems of common currency
conversion: nominal and PPP. These two approaches to GDP estimation have separate
+strengths and are generally used for different reasons.</p>

<p>Nominal GDP is useful for large-scope GDP comparison, either for a country or
region or on an international scale. The nominal GDP of an area is determined
using up-to-date market prices and shifts according to inflation. By
incorporating an area’s inflation rate in the GDP calculation, nominal GDP
can indicate when prices rise in an economy. The rate of price increases in
an economy is also factored into nominal GDP.</p></br>
